# ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker

## âœ… Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a fully automated *CI/CD pipeline* using *GitHub Actions* and *Docker*.  
It automates building a Docker image of a simple Node.js web application, pushing the image to Docker Hub, and optionally deploying it to Minikube.

## âœ… Features  
- Automated Docker image build and push using GitHub Actions  
- Docker Hub integration to store and share images  
- Simple Node.js web server running on port 3000  
- (Optional) Kubernetes deployment with Minikube  
- Demonstrates best practices in DevOps automation
